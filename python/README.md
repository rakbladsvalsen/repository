# Python client

Cool HTTP client.

⚠️ Note: 
This client implementation is still very rough around the edges. You're probably better off just using the HTTP API.

### Build

```sh
python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
```

### Test

Note: You'll need to install `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.

```sh
pytest -o log_cli=true repoclient/tests/
```

### Usage

TODO.
